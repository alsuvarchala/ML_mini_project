This is my mini machine learning project, designed to demonstrate the integration of a trained model into a web application using Flask.

Requirements:
1.Flask (Web Framework):
  Flask is a lightweight Python web framework used to build web applications and serve ML models through APIs.

2.pandas:
  pandas is a powerful data manipulation and analysis library that helps in handling structured data efficiently.

3.numpy:
  numpy is a fundamental package for numerical computing in Python, providing support for arrays and mathematical operations.

4.RandomForest (Algorithm):
  RandomForest is an ensemble learning algorithm that builds multiple decision trees and merges their results for accurate predictions.

5.pickle (Module):
  The pickle module is used to serialize (save) and deserialize (load) Python objects, such as trained machine learning models.

HTML & CSS (Frontend):
HTML structures the web pages, while CSS styles them to provide a visually appealing and user-friendly interface for model interaction.
